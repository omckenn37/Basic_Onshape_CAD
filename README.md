### Base

Onshape File : [Base](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/5c1d5796c9098d60ababfaa2/w/21b145938ec824bba0ea0ab5/e/f4dd323e01a533a46330e82d)

This was a pretty easy piece to make. Onshape seems pretty powerful and fast considering it runs in your browser. 

### Mount

Again, this piece was really easy to make. The linear pattern tool in Onshape is pretty straightforward. 

### Fork

This part took a bit more time, but was still overall pretty easy to complete. Onshape is pretty intuitive and makes tasks like mirroring objects really easy to do. 

### Tire

Onshape File : [Tire](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/5c1d5796c9098d60ababfaa2/w/21b145938ec824bba0ea0ab5/e/1afb94cdd5ba7c081ca68a40)

This was my first time making a revolved feature in Onshape. It's pretty much the same as it is in SolidWorks. 

### Wheel

This piece was another revolved feature. The process to make it was pretty similar to the tire. 

### Axle, Collar, Bearings

Onshape File: Axle : [Axle](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/5c1d5796c9098d60ababfaa2/w/21b145938ec824bba0ea0ab5/e/7950579751d92902e5faeceb)

Onshape File: Collar : [Collar](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/5c1d5796c9098d60ababfaa2/w/21b145938ec824bba0ea0ab5/e/5286deb87063eb8b74591380)

Onshape File: Bearing : [Bearing](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/5c1d5796c9098d60ababfaa2/w/21b145938ec824bba0ea0ab5/e/6eeca187b3c6474cb5249c92)

All three of these pieces were super simple. The bearing was made in only one feature, while the collar was made in 2 features. The axle was a cylinder extruded symmetrically with small "D" cuts on each end. 

### Assembly
